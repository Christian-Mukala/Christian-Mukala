# Hi, I'm Christian Mukala

**Operations Analyst | CPA Candidate** | Financial Systems, Marketing Analytics, Process Automation

I bridge the gap between finance and technology. With hands-on accounting experience (fund accounting, AP/AR, GAAP compliance) and technical skills in SQL, Python, and data visualization, I build systems that automate manual workflows, improve reporting accuracy, and give teams real visibility into their numbers.

Currently preparing for the CPA exam while building payment systems, financial databases, and analytics dashboards.
